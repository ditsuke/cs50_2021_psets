        <h3>Resources to Learn About Web Standards and Development</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            While there are innumerable resources one can use to learn about web development, I'll mention those I used myself while in the process of development of this site and found useful:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>: Previously called "Mozilla Developer Center", MDN is arguably the single best resource for 
                    new and seasoned web developers alike. Although less popular than its cousin W3Schools (often mistaken to have link to W3C), the documentation is much more expansive
                    and up to date with the latest and greatest the standards have to offer, including features that may not yet be implemented in all browsers. <br><br>
                    <img class="d-block mx-auto" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7565578?s=280&v=4" alt="MDN Logo"> <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>: W3Schools, while being rather similar to MDN, has its own advantages and shortcomings. Not updated as frequently
                    as MDN and a lot less detailed, W3Schools is still a useful resource for its relative simplicity and abundance of examples. Its a resource I'd recommend more
                    to those not used to reading official documentations, as in that case they may find themselves more familiar to the representational style of W3Schools which may help them
                    warm up to more professionally and comprehensively written resources like MDN. <br><br>
                    <img class="d-block mx-auto" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/W3Schools_logo.png" alt="W3Schools Logo"> <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a>: In its creators words, CSS-Tricks is "a website all about building websites". In practice I've found
                    that it is a great resource for some very specific problems, most pertaining to CSS, that a web developer may run into. It often has multiple solutions for the same problem
                    among which one is often exactly what they may be looking for. CSS-Tricks has great SEO so it is often at the top of keyword search results for most problems. 
                    Also, being the only resource here that's akin to a blog, it has daily articles many of which are very intriguing and good at informing and educating the reader about 
                    latest web technologies or wonderful things that can be accomplished with existing ones. <br><br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>: Stack Overflow is a QnA site for developers of all experience levels. In practice, it is the single
                    biggest site of its kind on the internet where hundreds and thousands of developers, many of whom very experienced and even renowned come together to share knowledge and solve
                    problems. While it is not focused on Web Development, one will find that most problems they may come up with in their web development journey already has a solution shared by someone on Stack Overflow.
                    This doesn't however mean that it's a complete resource but the reader can get help from some of the brightest minds there provided they adhere to the site's code of conduct and use it responsibly (it has a
                    reputation for not being kind on new users who break these and other community expectations). <br><br>
