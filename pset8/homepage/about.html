        <h3>About This Project</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This quaint static site is  my first attempt at web development. Although not perfect, I've invested a good amount of time and 
            put in considerable attention to detail to most of its aspects. 
            While it not comaparable to what the seasoned web developer can produce in a fraction of the 
            time I've invested, it was an educational, satisfying and enlightening journey for me allowing me to appreciate the power and evolution of web standards, HTML and CSS in particular.<br>
            As I got deeper into learning about CSS (though I can't do much of the awesome magic I've witnessed it's capable of), I discovered just how much it has grown over the past 2 decades.
            For instance, did you know that CSS is <i>now (<a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2011/03/08/breaking-news-htmlcss-is-turing-complete/" target="_blank">lemire.me</a>)</i> a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" target="_blank">turing complete</a> language!?
        </p>
        <p>
            If I am to talk about any particular challenge I had to go overcome in getting to this point in my CS50 journey, it has to be time.
            Being somewhat prone to procrastination, I can be slow at getting things done which is  why it has taken me long to wrap the course up.
            It has been one of the best decisions I've taken lately, and I'd like to thank <b>Prof. Malan</b> and <b>Brian Yu</b> for all their efforts and this opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting back to this site, in terms of the little <b>JavaScript</b> I've used, there are the two prominent buttons I'd like to mention first:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> The first  controls the site's <i>accent color</i> (honestly, it's used in too many places to be just that), and </li>
            <li> The second lets the user <i>toggle between Light and Dark themes</i>. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While the implementation of the random accent colors is not without its flaws (you have to cycle through a few
            to get one where the background and the text have enough contrast), it was interesting to implement (thank stackoverflow!). <br>
            I've also used the JavaScript-based open-source <a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Prism syntax highlighter</a>, which uses Javascript to tokenize and highlight the code client-side (using CSS), 
            with some custom theming to make the code snippets on the main page look the way I want.
        </p>
